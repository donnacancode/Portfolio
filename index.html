            <p>After spending over twenty years in the event management industry, I figured it was the right time to completely blow up my life and try something radically different- so here I am, attempting to learn how to code. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Naturally!</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            While I've never been the person to take things apart and figure out how they work (that was always my brother!), I've always enjoyed building things, in both the physical and metaphorical sense.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I may not be the most experienced coder, but if life has taught me anything, it's that you're never too old to learn new (really hard!) things!</p>
