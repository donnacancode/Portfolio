          <strong>Hi! I'm Donna!</strong>
          <br />
          Over the past two decades, I've worked hard to build a successful
          career in the event management industry. I figured it was the right
          time to completely blow up my life and try something radically
          different- so here I am, attempting to learn how to code.
          <br /><strong>Why not?</strong>
          <br />
          I've never been the person to take things apart and figure out how
          they work, but I've always enjoyed building things, in both the
          physical and metaphorical sense. While I may not be the most
          experienced coder, if life has taught me anything, it's that you're
          never too old to learn new things, and it's always a good idea to push
          yourself outside of your comfort zone!
          <br />
          When I'm not parked in front of a computer, I enjoy spending time with
          my husband, our dog, and our three cats.  I am so excited to learn how to make websites both pretty and functional!  I have two personal projects in the pipeline that I can't wait to get started on!
